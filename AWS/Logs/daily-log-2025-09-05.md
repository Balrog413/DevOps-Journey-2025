# 📅 2025-09-03 – Cloud Foundations & Python Kickoff
🎯 Focus Areas: AWS Cloud Practitioner Prep, Python for DevOps  
⏱️ Total Study Time: 8 hours (with breaks)  
🚀 Status: Day 1 of serious execution – KodeKloud PRO activated, exam booked, learning launched!

## ✅ What I Completed:
### 📘 AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) Modules:
- **Module 1:** Introduction to the Cloud (Concepts, Benefits, Deployment Models)  
- **Module 2:** Compute in the Cloud (EC2, Lambda, Auto Scaling, Elastic Beanstalk)  
Studied: 13:00 – 19:00 (with breaks) → solid foundation built

### 🐍 Python for DevOps (KodeKloud PRO):
- **Module:** Python Basics  
- **Focus:** Variables, data types, input/output, basic scripts  
Session: 21:00 – 23:00 → late-night grind activated

## 💡 Key Learnings:
- Finally connected why **EC2 is IaaS** and **Lambda is serverless**.  
- Understood how cloud compute replaces physical servers.  
- Wrote my first Python script that asks for user input and prints a greeting — small step, big meaning.

## 🔧 Tools Used:
- KodeKloud Engineer Pro (labs + playgrounds)  
- AWS Free Tier (exploring EC2 console)  
- VS Code (for Python practice)

## 💬 Personal Note:
Today I stopped planning and started executing. I paid for **KodeKloud PRO** because I’m serious. I booked my **AWS exam — 2 October 2025** — because I’m accountable. This is the first day of me reclaiming ground.

## ⏭ Next Steps:
- Finish Python Basics modules by tomorrow  
- Start Linux Fundamentals on KodeKloud  
- Begin flashcards for AWS services (EC2, S3, VPC, IAM)

📅 **Exam Countdown:** 30 days to AWS Cloud Practitioner!
