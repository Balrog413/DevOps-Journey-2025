# Notes â€” Linux Basics (KodeKloud)

**Completed:** Sep 2025

## Key skills learned
- Linux CLI basics: navigation, files, permissions (ls, cd, chmod, chown).
- Package management (apt / yum depending on distro).
- Systemd services: start/stop/enable/disable, checking logs with `journalctl`.
- Networking basics (ifconfig/ip, ping, netstat/ss).
- Managing processes (ps, top, systemctl).
- Editing files with nano/vim and basic shell scripting.
- Basic security & users: sudo, useradd, groups.

## Labs I completed (examples to paste)
- Created a systemd service for a simple Python script and verified auto-start.
- Parsed logs with `journalctl` and created a small log-check script.
- Installed and configured `nginx` and served a static page.

## Next steps
- Capture 2 lab screenshots to include in `labs/`.
- Create a small demo that uses a systemd service to run a Python collector that writes a file to S3 (good for EC2 project).
